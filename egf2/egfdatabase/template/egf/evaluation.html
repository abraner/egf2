        <div id="title">Gun Fitting Evaluation</div>
    <div id="article1">A Gun Fitting Evaluation is a program that I have developed over the years after working with hundreds of clients.
        It has evolved into a program that is way more comprehensive than just a standard gun fitting.
        <br>
        <br>
        Shooting a shotgun is a partnership between you and your gun, once your gun is fitted to you, it's up to you to hold up your end of the partnership.
        I believe that there are six pieces to this partnership, gun fit is only one of those pieces.
        You can have the best fitted stock in the world but if you don't know, understand, and master the other five pieces of the puzzle, the fitted stock alone will not
        help you reach your highest potential.
        <br>
        <br>
        Who can benefit from this evaluation?
        Anyone who shoots a shotgun. It doesn't matter what discipline of shooting you enjoy, Trap, Skeet, Five Stand, Sporting Clays,
        FITASC, or upland game birds, all the pieces are the same.
        I encourage clients to have the evaluation done before having a lesson with an instructor in their chosen discipline,
        that way they know that their gun is fitted properly, they understand all the pieces and their importance, and have developed some muscle memory to their gun mount.
        Then when you go for a lesson and the instructor evaluates your gun fit and mounting consistency, you will be able to head out to the field to learn the technique
        and strategies of your chosen discipline. This way you are not spending all your lesson time trying to get your gun to fit you or teach you how to mount your gun.
        <br>
        <br>
        This program will help both the new and experienced shooter as well to improve their shooting.
        Some of my clients have had profound improvements in their shooting; everyone comes away learning something that helps them along the way.
        Almost all say the same thing when we are through and that is, " I have never heard some of that information before".
        <br>
        <br>
        The Evaluation takes between 3 to 4 hours, which consist of 2-3 hours of classroom and fitting time, and about 1 hour shooting at a grease pattern board to bring everything
        together.<a href="/egfdatabase/services">    Click here for Gun Fitting Evaluation pricing</a>
